        <h1 id="when-we-cannot-afford-to-not-plan">When we cannot afford to not plan</h1>

<p>There are times when planning is not only beneficial, but even essential. One such time was when I was planning my path toward graduation.</p>

<p>As part of this reflection class, I wrote a dialogue with a classmate. Thsi dialogue was themed around our experiences while changing our majors. During this process, I went through many of my <strong>study plans</strong>(need context) from over the 4 years.</p>

<p>During the assignment, my initial view on my past study plans was overwhelmingly negative. I compared my later extremely sparse textfiles with my classmate’s well formatted table and used it as evidence of my lack of planning. Even more sowhen comparing with my early study plans which planned for options such as exchange etc, I was very dismissive of my work. I viewed this as a “degradation” of the quality of the study plans with time.</p>

<p>However, as I review these study plans with perhaps a more generous approach, I begin to see an improvement of planning as I define it in this portfolio.</p>

<p>the initial ISE “plan” had structure, but its purpose was to cross the barrier of approval from my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">peer mentor</code>. It demonstrated that I had a path to graduation within a reasonable amount of time, but had little in way of an interest area. My <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">technical electives</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inquiry</code> classes were left blank.</p>

<p>The initial CS plan had structure, and its purpose was to ensure that I could clear foundation classes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1k and 2k</code> classes within a year. This would then provide me the base with which to apply for higher level classes in subsequent years.</p>

<p>While the later plans had less structure, They were the most concrete. the specific classes I wanted to take to fulfil specific graduation targets such as focus area were clarified. I was able to decide far ahead of time and plan for which classes I would need by the end of y4 and hence which classes I would need to complete by the end of y3 (because some classes were only offered in one semester)</p>

<p>So over time, I oranically learned that planning was essential, and that this was something I could not afford to not do, lest I further delay my graduation.</p>

<p>My inital perception was that I was not a planner. Compared to my classmate’s study plans, mine were very sparse.</p>
<ul>
  <li>excerpt from original collab post</li>
</ul>

<p>However, on reviewing, I realise that while sparse, my initial interpretation of my study plans was not generous. I viewed them as lacking and insufficient in many ways. However, after writing that assignment and further thinking, I observe a different trend.</p>

<p>While I might not have generally been a very detailed planner after the inital study plan, the fact is that I still made the plans of my own volition becuase I recognised the necessity of these plans. The captions of the original post are dismissive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">only addressing the immediate problem</code>, however, these were immediate problems which were steps toward adressing the larger problem of graduation.</p>

<p>As I got closer to graduation, the required structure was less important. While I was/might be mocked for having my study plan as a text file, wihtout any of the nice formatting that others might have included in their excel sheets etc, it sered its purpose in giving me a reference and the ability to look beyond the immediate semester, and conviniently add notes such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pre-requisites</code> which I might need to fulfill if I wanted to take that class.</p>

<ul>
  <li>planning can come in different forms</li>
  <li>not set in stone but still useful to have a direction</li>
  <li>the idea of “I’ll take this step first” because it puts me in a good state to figure out what comes next
    <ul>
      <li>eg. year 2 plan that focused on clearing foundation 1/2k classes first which are required for others</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>while working on collab post
examined artefacts related to my chaning major
while the inital conclusion from the dialogue was that I did not really plan as much
I noticed a trend of increased planning.</p>

<p>Initial plan was just to fulfull requiremets</p>

<p>then subsequent plans were looking at <strong>only</strong> the incoming semester</p>

<p>at the end, my plans started to include more semesters
and had more specific goals, such as which focus area(s) I wanted to work toward.</p>

<p>why?
when I initally changed, there was no need to be very specific. I had time and space to make up and change my mind.
However, as the graduation deadline came closer, the breadth of options I had began to shrink.
sem1/sem2 only modules, graduation requirements such as CP (internship) and 4k with prerequisites began to appear</p>

<p>failed to get the 5k simulation module
but managed to complete others
had to double down on internship applications –&gt; iffy if I want employers as a audience</p>
