<p>// intention is important
// mismatched purpose
// misaligned/wrong purpose</p>

<p>When we have the luxury of time and energy, it makes sense that we <strong>should</strong> plan. However, we should not get too attached to the plans we make. We should also be clear of the intent of the plan we make.</p>

<p>By comparing two experiences, one which I attempted to change, and one which I had to change, I aim to further investigate the luxury of planning.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>when is it too late to change a plan?
- when the booklet is released to students?
- on the actual day of execution
- both arguments are valid, so really it depends

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OLD TEXT PART
—</p>

<p>In July 2021, because of the covid-19 restrictions, university orientation programmes were moved online. USP decided to hold part of our online orientation programme in the game Minecraft. I joined the project late, at a stage when most of the plans were finalized.</p>

<p>When joining the project, I had many concerns with the sequence of activities. The camp would begin with some games which required familiarity with game controls and mechanics. I was concerned that participants who had not played Minecraft or other first person games would struggle to participate. Furthermore, participants would have a diminished experience if they were stuck resolving technical issues while their peers were having fun in competitive games. I expressed my concern first verbally, then followed up by sending messages to our games committee group chat.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/afford_to_plan/message1.png" alt="" />
<img src="/assets/img/afford_to_plan/message2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was concerned about the experience that the participants would have while engaging with the activities when I sent these messages. I further suggested that the participants’ first exposure to Minecraft should be the activity where they worked with their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">house-mates</code> to build on an island. This would be a less time-sensitive activity which would allow us time to resolve technical issues and let participants familiarise themselves with the game mechanics which they would use in subsequent games. However, the programme organizer disagreed and initially resisted my proposal, sending this rebuttal to the same group chat.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/afford_to_plan/message3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>They <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">believed?</code> that we should not make any changes to the sequence of events because they had already sent out the camp booklet containing said schedules to participants, and suggested a compromise where some of the unstructured <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">house bonding time</code> could be used for building.</p>

<p>The plan of the schedule in this situation had been set in stone and the organizer was unwilling to change it because it had been shared publicly. Making unecessary changes could be messy and confusing for participants referencing different versions of the digital booklet.</p>

<p>so the question here is: what was the purpose of the planned schedule? to give participants a clear and firm idea of the sequence of activities which they would be experiencing, or to provide a good experience for them. Both are valid purposes for having a plan, and so long as we disagreed on the purpose of the plan, we would not be able to have satisfying agreement.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next experience was in Nov 2022, when I was doing a class project in IE3105 Fundamentals of Systems Engineering and Architecture. This was a class which “aims to introduce students to the fundamental concepts and underlying principles of systems engineering, including systems thinking, as well as the design and management of complex systems”.</p>

<p>Our class project was to use these principles taught in class to design a solution for aiding visually impaired users locate and board their desired bus independently.</p>

<p>When beginning this project, I focused on the second half of the project description, focusing more on the “for visually impaired users” section and less on the “use principles taught in class” part.</p>

<p>As a result, when I strongly disagreed with the professor and my classmates’ idea of what a “needs” of a blind person would be and disagreed with my group’s approach, I argued against them. However, with the deadline of the group project approaching and group mates unwilling to change their minds, I gave in and did the project their way. I built a prototype which fulfilled their product requirements, grumbling the entire way. We wrote and executed a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test plan</code> in which we blindfolded ourselves and demonstrated our prototype and how we claimed it would satisfy the requirements of the project. We received a good mark for the final project and professor was impressed.</p>

<p>After the semester was over, the professor invited his contact from SG Enable to give feedback on our prototype. A visually impaired person tested our product and gave feedback. Much of what he said aligned with my initial opinions on how useful the prototype we constructed would be.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/afford_to_plan/feedback-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">An excerpt from the email sent by SG Enable after the feedback session. They validated that we had identified the major pain point and agreed that our solution addressed well.</code></p>

<p>Specifically, the tester said during our physical meeting that a much simpler product which identified and announced the unique 5-digit bus stop code would be most useful. He could then use the information with a bus arrival application which he was already familiar with. Once again I had successfully identified the pertinent issues in the project and raised them up, but how did these shortcomings of the prototype not affect us in our final grading?</p>

<hr />

<p>I now ask myself what was the purpose of the plans?</p>
<ul>
  <li>minecraft plan by org was</li>
  <li>
    <p>minecraft plan by me wAs</p>
  </li>
  <li>ie plan by prof was</li>
  <li>ie plan by me was</li>
</ul>

<p>so when the intention of the plans conflict, it cannot really be resolved</p>
<ul>
  <li>minecraft disagreement unresolved</li>
  <li>look at ie project</li>
  <li>my purpose in writing interim report and part of plan was xyz</li>
  <li>however, prof’s purpose was something else</li>
  <li>so when i made and executed my plan without an accurate purpose, of course it went off course and got me the lowest score</li>
  <li>my plan did not align with the learning outcomes and assessment method</li>
  <li>so it would have brought me somewhere (good product), but not necessarily where I wanted (good grades and learning MBSE)</li>
</ul>

<p>With a bit of time away from the projects, I start to look back on what I learned from these two experiences.</p>

<p>I have learned to focus on the user audience and their needs. However, there are also times when focusing too much about an audience is detrimental. In the IE3105 project, my approach might have produced a better product, but perhaps product quality is not always the measure of a project’s success.</p>

<p>I now can classify these into two different types of projects: Content and Skill projects. Each has a different purpose and hence a different reason why we should pay attention to audience.</p>

<p>In content projects, our goal is the outcome. We care about the user because their experience is how we measure success. There are other constraints of time and budget, but ultimately, success is measured by the participants’ satisfaction.</p>

<p>In skill projects, the goal is practice. When writing, we care about audience because writing for others requires conscious thought and practice. In the IE3105 project, the goal was to practice and demonstrate the systems thinking principles, with the quality of the final product having a lower priority.</p>

<p>Using this new classification of projects, I can re-evaluate my thoughts on the interim report I submitted for the IE3105 project.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/afford_to_plan/decision.png" alt="" />
<img src="/assets/img/afford_to_plan/needs.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Excerpts from interim report submitted for IE3105. I received the lowest mark in the class, 6/10, because the professor said it was “only a concept” and “lacked a detailed design”.</p>

<p>At the time I was angry because my report scored so low. I had included detailed explanations for the design elements which would be included or omitted from my proposed solution, and further assessments of how feasible these elements would be to prototype. I had lost marks for not including a detailed design, for a product which had not been developed to that level yet. Meanwhile, some classmates had scored much better by submitting  solutions which were too impractical to prototype, but had included detailed designs.</p>

<p>Using the new lens to view IE3105 as a skills project, I now understand that the interim report was meant to force us to adhere to the structure of creating that detailed design as part of the report even if it was to be scrapped going forward.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<p>So why do we care about the audience? Because this care serves as practicing  the art of communication when writing. There will be many times when the audience should not take highest priority because the project serves a different purpose. A focus on audience and user-centric design should not be a universal rule, it is merely one of many tools for achieving the higher purpose of projects.</p>

<p>So back to you, audience person. You are a constraint in this skills project where I learn to reflect through following a methodology and hopefully clearly presenting my reflection to someone else.</p>
