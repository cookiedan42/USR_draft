<p>Plans are generally beneficial (link: minecraft ) or even essential (link: study plans). There are times too where outcomes would be better if we planned but are unable to (link: stoic). However, we can sometimes afford not to plan. The challenge is identifying when this is the case.</p>

<p>By observing some traits of an event where I more consciously did not plan too much, I will attempt to figure this out
This event was the “collective faire 2023”, a USP/NUSC event where “students could run booths to share a skill or teach a talent”. I ran a booth where participants could design and press button badges. During that evening, the badge press I was relying on snapped in half, and examining how I responded gives insight to when I should allow myself to plan less.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="when-we-have-specific-experience">When we have specific experience</h1>

<p>I had run a similar booth at a prior event using the same press. I had experience with the press and teaching people to use it. So I had confidence in myself to adapt and react to the different participants. I had encountered challenges during that previous event, such as encouraging participants unconfident in their art skills. I knew how to address these challenges and was prepared for most of the difficulties which I could encounter, so I did not need a concrete plan of how to do so.</p>

<p>This approach was validated during the event when these expected challenges cropped up and I was able to address them appropriately. The <strong>specific</strong> knowledge and experience I had were sufficient to head off the problems.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="when-the-stakes-are-low">when the stakes are low</h1>

<p>When the badge press broke in half, it was not a situation I was prepared for. Honestly, even if I had tried to plan, I probably would not have been something I would have planned for either. <br />
<img src="/assets/img/afford_not_to_plan/broken_machine.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>However, because having the booth running for the entire event was not critical, I was not too <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">concerned?</code>. As I began to pull together ideas for how to salvage the situation, the first step was to gain access to the makers’ studio (our USP prototyping room), which might give me more options of resolving the situation. I asked a friend to help me contact someone who had access to the studio, and their response was something along the lines of “They’re not sure if they have the tools for you to fix it”.  My response? “Best case, I fix it. Worst case, it’s still broken and we’re back where we started.”</p>

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">an excerpt from an instagram post I made about the event later that night recollecting the events of the day</code></p>

<p>I was not overly invested in the <strong>specific outcome</strong> of getting the press fixed. If it could be, great! If not, oh well. The stakes (to me) were low. If I had signed a contract to provide a certain number of badges or run the booth for a specific amount of time, then the stakes would be higher and that would probably necessitate some planning for this situation. However, I was fine with just ending it if there was not any way to move forward.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="when-we-are-prepared">when we are prepared</h1>
<p>That approach of “best case, worst case” was only possible because of my <strong>general</strong> experience. I had been in charge of the makers’ studio back when I was a first year, and had worked on projects there on and off over the years. Thus, I had a rough idea of what tools were available. More importantly, I had the confidence and knowledge from years of home projects to accomplish my goals by using limited tools in ways they were not designed for.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/afford_not_to_plan/makers_access.jpg" alt="" />    <br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">caption</code>
While others were working through the “official” ways of gaining me access to makers’ studio, I contacted people I knew could tap me into the room.</p>

<p>Once in the studio, I felt hopeful in solving the issue without having a concrete plan, such as having the correct size of <a href="">hex bit</a> prepared and tested replacing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> of the badge presses before the event, designating it as the backup.</p>

<p>I would just attempt to use whatever was available to take the head off the broken press body and put it onto the other press body we had. I was not certain that they were compatible, but it was worth a shot nonetheless. Eventually, with a spray can of WD-40 and a pair of pliers, I was able to swap the crimping heads.</p>

<p><strong>General</strong> knowledge about the tools in maker’s studio enabled me to think through the possible actions I could take. <strong>General</strong> knowledge of knowing who could help me gain access to the tools enabled me to take the first step in knowing that the tools were accessible. <strong>General</strong> experience with fixing mechanical problems helped me get through the unforeseen problem I was facing.  That was why even with no concrete steps to follow, I could take individual steps toward my goal of fixing the badge press and continuing the booth. These were ways that I (unknowingly) was prepared to solve the problem.</p>

<p>The booth could continue, however, it had to change. The badges which participants were pressing for themselves with the replacement body were coming out damaged. I managed to identify the issue, which was that part of the body was slightly misaligned. To compensate for this, I began to press the badges for participants instead of letting them do it themselves. Damaged badges was not a desirable outcome, so I had to compromise on the experience of letting participants have the satisfaction of pressing their own badges.</p>

<hr />

<p>Through this experience, I identify these criteria for the type of problems where it might be ok to not plan. However, there is another more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">individual?</code> criteria.</p>

<h1 id="avoid-over-preparing">avoid over preparing</h1>
<p>If I had planned for the breakage scenario, it could have been resolved “better”. Perhaps I would have foreseen the alignment issue, perhaps I could have makers’ studio access on standby rather than having to reach out to others urgently. However, the formation of these concrete and tested plans would have required much more time and energy from me, time and energy which I did not have.</p>

<p>Other times, the concrete nature of a plan might interfere with the desired outcome. Had I planned to use the proper tools only to discover them not available, I might have gotten stuck thinking about how the plan failed. Whereas when I begin with nothing, all options are equally viable and can be more equally compared.</p>

<h1 id="so-when-can-we-afford-to-not-plan">So when can we afford to not plan?</h1>

<p>When we have specific and general experience which prepares us to overcome the predicted and unpredicted challenges which we might encounter. When we are not too concerned with a specific outcome happening, either because the cost of failure is low, or because we are willing and able to compromise on the results.</p>

<p>Importantly, when these conditions are satisfied, we can still act with purpose and direction, even if there is no concrete plan. Regardless of the presence or absence of a plan, we should still try to resolve problems when we encounter them. It might be more challenging without a specific guide, but <strong>preparation</strong> can provide the shape of what the next step can be. Without s plan on how to continue the booth after the press broke, I could still act with purpose and take individual steps toward the outcome I desired. First by gaining access to the studio, then by fixing the press, lastly by modifying the experience based on the shortcomings of the repaired press. These actions were guided by the general knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>Being able to identify these scenarios is very useful. Planning less saves us unnecessary effort when we can afford to do so. Perhaps a deliberate choice to non plan and embrace the challenges can be a form of preparation for the times when we cannot afford to plan. To experience the stress of not having a clear next step, but knowing that we must take some step toward our goal, and comforted by the safety net of this being a low stakes situation we can afford to fail in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we can embrace the stressful moment we find ourself in, it becomes easier to also embrace the satisfaction and spontaneity that comes with solving a problem. It is a different thrill and satisfaction from a well executed plan. Not better or worse, just different.</p>
