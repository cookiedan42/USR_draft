<h1 id="when-we-cannot-afford-to-plan">When we cannot afford to plan</h1>

<p>Planning requires time and energy to execute properly. In situations where these ingredients are lacking, insisting on planning is futile and might even be counter productive if we do not have the right clarity of mind. I observe this situation occuring through a Computer Science project I worked on in the first semester of my fourth year in university, then attempt to use aspects of stoicism which i learned in USP class which I took in my third year to further clarify.</p>

<hr />

<p>This computer science project I worked on in CS3219 Software Engineering Principles and Patterns, which I took in the first semester of my 4th year. This was a project where a group of 4 students design a web platform using <a href="">microservices</a>. Each group member designed and built one or two microservices, and we would link them together to form the final product.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the project deadline, I was having a tough time with my mental health. The part of the project report I was supposed to write felt too overwhelming to even begin work on. However, I still wanted to contribute to the project. Hence, I asked a group member to help me break it down into more manageable sections.</p>

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a message from me to my groupmate asking for help (in blue), followed by his response (in black)</code></p>

<p>At the time, I thought of this request as merely being accountable to my group mate. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as obseved from my statement of "&lt;see feedback&gt;"</code> By communicating my limitations to him, he would not expect work which I was unable to deliver, and would hence be able to plan around my limitations. Furthermore, by offering a method for me to continue contributing, even if I did less than my “fair share”, I would not be abandoning the project. Specifically, since I had designed and coded certain parts of the project, only I had a full understanding of those sections and would best be able to explain it in the report.</p>

<p>My group mate  helped immensely, breaking down the daunting work into more manageable sections which I was then able to slowly work through.</p>

<hr />

<p>In this situation, I did not have the mental capacity to <strong>plan</strong> out my section of the work. The goal of “do your assigned section” was too large, and I was not able to break it down into smaller actionable steps for myself. Hence I had to rely on my groupmate to plan for me, and I executed the plan he made.</p>

  <h2 id="talk-about-stoicism-time">talk about stoicism time</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>While at the time I merely viewed this as being accountable to a friend, when I look back with some distance, I can see some influence of the philosoply of stoicism which I had internalised appearing in my actions.</p>

<p>In the second semester of my third year, I took a class in USP, UPI2212 Technologies of the Self: from Socrates to Self-Help. We read many authors who had written about different philosophies. One philosophy which caught my interest was stoicism, specifically Epictetus’ writings on stoicism.</p>

<p>A simplified understanding of Stoicism as is as a philosophy to life based around a few principles: I control only my thoughts, actions and emotions. Obstacles and setbacks are not things I can change. Therefore, I should not be upset regardless of the outcome. In some modern interpretations, such as by Ryan Holiday, stoicism is a cold, individualistic approach to life.</p>

<p>Epictetus wrote that someone who truly lived by stoicism would not be upset by incidents out of their control. Many readers have interpreted to mean that we should choose not to experience negative emotion when facing setbacks . However, having struggled with various emotional and mental health problems during that same semester. I felt excluded from this philosophy which I otherwise wanted to agreed with and wanted to live by. I therefore decided to use my final essay to try reconciling these differences through reevaluating Epictetus’ approach to stoicism.</p>

<p>In that essay, I presented an alternative interpretation of “emotions” by using Seneca’s model of passions in “On Anger”.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/not_afford_to_plan/movements.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">An except from my essay which introduces Seneca's model of passions. The first movement is the involuntary experience. The second movement is the thought of action in response to the initial experience. The third movement is the action taken based on the thoughts of the second movement.</code></p>

<p>In opposition to the conventional understanding of emotions as purely the feeling, Seneca’s model separates the involuntary jolt from the actions which we take in reaction to the emotional jolt. Through separating the experience from the reaction, I presented a method of practicing stoicism by categorizing the involuntary jolt of the first movement and the thoughts of the second movement as part of the reality which we have to accept, while the actions we take in the third movement, being within our control, is the component of emotion which we should control. This was a more empathetic approach where having negative feelings is not something to be criticised, but rather something to accept and work with. This essay was the first step where I attempted to integrate some compassion for the self into my understanding of stoicism.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now, looking at the situation through the lens of stoicism, the actions which I perceived as merely being accountable, was in fact me applying stoicism. Even though I was not consciously practicing it, it had seeped into the way I acted. By accepting the internal struggles I was facing as not in my control, I could then work around these limitations. Instead of being consumed by guilty thoughts of not contributing equally or anxiety over the impending deadline, I was able to construct a plan to work around these limitations by asking for help. Without planning to do so, I had practiced the self-compassionate stoicism I had developed in the prior semester.</p>

<p>Learning about and practicing stoicism had <strong>prepared</strong> me for this situation, even if I had not <strong>planned</strong> for it. The unconsious shift in mindset from practicing the philosophy during the class had helped me approach the problem in a better way, even if I did not have a clear plan to follow.</p>

<hr />

<p>However, I cannot rely on this nebulous idea of <strong>prepared</strong> to carry me through all future incidents. Therefore, in situations where we cannot afford to plan, the only way is to plan to afford. Another part of my essay of stoicism provides an idea of how we might do this.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/not_afford_to_plan/stoic_friends.png" alt="" />
another thing seneca wrote was : asking friend for help with anger</p>

<p>Seneca tells us to put obstacles in the way of our known vices (times when we deviate from stoicism). This is a plan which must be enacted before we encounter these vices, and can involve friends and/or other plans for ourselves.</p>

<p>One way that I see going forward is to highlight these challenging times ahead of time to groupmates, so that instead of informing them at the time of crisis, we can plan for my impairment ahead of time as part of the work schedule, making it a more predictable non-productive time.  However, in the unlikely scenario where some other trigger occurs at an unplanned time, then I would still have to fallback on the <strong>preparation</strong> which I have picked up over the years.</p>

<p>preparation in the short term can turn into long term plans</p>
