# Conclusion  

Planning is generally a good thing to do. Regardless of whether life throws a spanner into the works, it can be easier to adapt existing plans to the new situation than have to start from scratch. However, to be to attached to an existing plan in the face of new information which contradicts the __intent__ of the original plan is foolish.  

When we can afford to plan, we should. When we cannot afford to plan, we hope that we planned to afford the compromises and adaptations which come along with it. When we cannot afford to not plan, then we absolutely must, because the cost of failure would be too high. But when we can afford to not plan, not overthinking the problem might be useful in enabling us to just enjoy the process.
