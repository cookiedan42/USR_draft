        <h1 id="can-we-afford-to-plan">Can we afford to plan?</h1>

<p>In the past 6 years of my life, I have experienced many life-changing events. Some of them were very public, such as the covid-19 pandemic which forced us into quarantines, while others were more personal and I shall not discuss them in this blog. Throughout these events, one common thread is that they forced a change in any plans I had at the time.</p>

<p>At one point, I even felt that there was no point in making long term plans, because it seemed that any plans I made were destined to be wiped away by life circumstances. I went from having many long term plans to seemingly surviving semester by semester.</p>

<p>Looking back on my time in university, there are many situations where my lack of planning has caused problems. It is “common sense” that more planning is generally better than less planning. However, given the limited time and energy we have, it is impossible to make perfecct plans for everything we do, especially if we have to account for <strong>black swan</strong> events. Therefore, in the following series of reflectiosns, I will attempt to consider the problem of prioritising planning.</p>

<p>This will take place in 4 parts.</p>

<p>When can we not afford to not plan</p>
<ul>
  <li>(reworked collab post on study plan)</li>
  <li>there are situations where planning is essential</li>
  <li>as graduation draws near, my study plans have had to adapt to my changing needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>When can we afford to plan
(reworked minecraft/ise post)</p>
<ul>
  <li>when we have the luxury of time before having to execute, we can plan</li>
  <li>however, sticking too closely to a plan or an idea can hamper our progress</li>
</ul>

<p>when can we not afford to plan</p>
<ul>
  <li>(reworked stoic/cs post)</li>
  <li>when time is short</li>
  <li>when mental energy is lacking</li>
</ul>

<p>when can we afford to not plan</p>
<ul>
  <li>(new post on collective faire)</li>
  <li>when experience &gt; outcome</li>
  <li>when cost of failure/ stakes are low</li>
  <li>when willing to take the failure &gt; slightly different from above</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>cannot escape the fact that planning is important
however, with a more consious understanding of when and why I should plan, I can make more appopriate plans and the right kind of plans</p>
