# questions
1. can I just define what I mean by "a plan"?
    - clear structured steps
    - vague direction --> call this a vision/mission?

# proposal body

1. audience & purpose
- self and employer
- self: understanding how my understanding of planning has changed
- employer: rationalizing aspects of my personal history which are very messy/unplanned and how going forward, I can better plan
2. organizing principle
- can(not) afford to (not) plan

3. ideas for micro structure
- 4 main posts, one for each quadrant

    |           |cannot afford  | can afford|
    |---        |---            |---        |

- When can we not afford to not plan
(reworked collab post on study plan)
there are situations where planning is essential
as graduation draws near, my study plans have had to adapt to my changing needs.

- When can we afford to plan (reworked minecraft/ise post)
when we have the luxury of time before having to execute, we can plan
however, sticking too closely to a plan or an idea can hamper our progress

- when can we not afford to plan
(reworked stoic/cs post)
when time is short
when mental energy is lacking

- when can we afford to not plan
(new post on collective faire)
when experience > outcome
when cost of failure/ stakes are low
when willing to take the failure > slightly different from above

- conclusion: back to what is a plan?
    - structured steps? or general direction
    - I've been telling myself that I can't or won't plan, but looking over these posts, even when I don't have clear actionable steps from where I am to where I want/need to be, I still can try to look toward my end goals, and think of the next immediate step that brings me in that direction, even if I don't quite plan the whole path
    - planning to not plan : perhaps seneca planning for anger can appear here instead?

5. artefacts
- old posts are keeping artefacts
- add one extract from reading to stoic on seneca "planning for anger"
- new badge post: refer to draft

6. outline for one post
- refer to draft
