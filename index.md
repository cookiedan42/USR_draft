# Can we afford to plan?

In the past 6 years of my life, I have experienced many life-changing events. Some of them were very public, such as the covid-19 pandemic which forced us into quarantines, while others were more personal and I shall not discuss them in this blog. Throughout these events, one common thread is that they forced a change in the life plans I had at the time.   

At one point, I even felt that there was no point in making long term plans because it seemed that any plans I made were destined to be made infeasible by circumstances. I went from having many long term plans to seemingly surviving semester by semester.  

Looking back on my time in university, there are many situations where my lack of planning has caused problems. It is "common sense" that more planning is generally better than less planning. However, given the limited time and energy we have, it is impossible to make perfect plans for everything we do, especially if we have to fully account for unexpected events. Therefore, in the following series of reflectiosns, I will attempt to consider the problem of prioritising planning.

This will take place in 4 parts.

When can we not afford to not plan 
- (reworked collab post on study plan)
- there are situations where planning is essential
- as graduation draws near, my study plans have had to adapt to my changing needs.

When can we afford to plan
(reworked minecraft/ise post)
- when we have the luxury of time before having to execute, we can plan
- however, sticking too closely to a plan or an idea can hamper our progress

when can we not afford to plan
- (reworked stoic/cs post)
- when time is short
- when mental energy is lacking


when can we afford to not plan
- (new post on collective faire)
- when experience > outcome 
- when cost of failure/ stakes are low
- when willing to take the failure > slightly different from above



# Conclusion
cannot escape the fact that planning is important
however, with a more consious understanding of when and why I should plan, I can make more appopriate plans and the right kind of plans









At the start of this project, I believed that planning was not useful in a time of turbulance when m life got turned upside down so frequently. What is the point of planning when they will never be completed? But through examining these situations, I now see that plans need not be followed exacty. There must be room to change and adapt as we need. There are also times when we must plan, but this does not mean creating a full plan to reach the destination. plotting out the next few steps conciously and keeping the rest open has value and makes more sense sometimes. The next few steps are unlikely to be overturned too dramatically, unlike far off ideas which might rely on a lot of factors outside of our control. lastly, preparation as a "loose plan", which is separate from concrete plans, but still help myself when encountering future situations.
