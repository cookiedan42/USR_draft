# When can we afford not to plan?

It is often claimed that "if you fail to plan, you plan to fail". While this is generally a good rule of thumb, there are situations where we can afford to not plan. The challenge is accurately identifying these situations. A perfect plan which predicts all the potential pitfalls and the ways which we can mitigate them is probably be better than winging it, but the effort to make such a plan so might just not be worth it. By analysing aspects of an event where I barely planned, I will attempt to identify some of the factors that contribute to when we can afford to not plan. 

This event was the "Collective Faire 2023", an event where "students could run booths to share a skill or teach a talent". I ran a booth for participants to design and press [button badges](). During that evening, the badge press I was relying on snapped in half. Examining my experiences before the event and response to this scenario gives insight to when I can allow myself to plan less.

# Before the event
I needed materials to run my booth, but I did not want to pay the possibly high price for the materials given that there was under a week left between my idea and the day of the event. The price for a guaranteed delivery before the event was around $70, which I did not think was reasonable to pay. There was a cheaper alternative which ran the risk of being delivered after the event day. I asked the organiser if it would be possible to claim for cost of these materials.    

My initial request was rejected, and I considered not running the booth. I then received news that the funds were being requested, but was instructed not to make the purchase yet.

At this time, I wanted to make badges but was unsure if I could get the funds to do so as part of the collective faire. I decided to just go ahead and make the purchase anyway.

I chose to buy the cheaper set of materials. The delivery time for this shop was risky because it might arrive after the event, there was a very real possibilty that the materials might not arrive in time. The fund claim was risky, I still had not received confirmation that I could claim this specific purchase. I made the purchase anyway.

# When we are willing to "fail"  

As I look back on why I made this decision, I realise that I was willing to "fail". I was willing to "fail" in not running my booth. I was willing to "fail" in not getting the funding claim approved. These "failing" scenarios of being unable to run the booth due to lack of materials, or having purchased the materials and being unable to claim for them were both acceptable to me.

In another [blog post on my study plans](/pages/studyplan.md), I come to realise that having a concrete plan from start to end is less important than I initially thought. Through that post I have come to understand that a plan where only the immediate next few steps are concrete, and later steps are left more open can still be very useful. Through this lens, I can view the way I handled the purchase as one step in the right direction toward possibly running my booth. However, because the outcome of the purchase was not guaranteed, any plans which extend beyond this specific step would be very uncertain, and could be a waste of effort if that first step failed. 

Taking this idea of step-by-step plans further, I will examine my actions to resolve the breaking of the badge press during the event to figure out what prepared me execute such a step-by-step action plan.

Halfway during the event, the badge press broke in half. It was not a situation I had planned for, and I had to figure out what to do about it.

Having the booth running for the entire event was not an essential goal for me, so I was able to step away and think clearly. As I began to pull together ideas for how to salvage the situation, my idea for the first step was to gain access to the makers' studio (our USP prototyping room). This step would provide me more options to resolve the situation. I asked a friend to help me contact someone who had access to the studio, and their response was something along the lines of "They're not sure if they have the tools for you to fix it".  My reply? "Best case, I fix it. Worst case, it's still broken and we're back where we started." I had no concrete plan on how to fix the press, but I was willing to try.

This approach of "best case, worst case" was only possible because of my __general__ experience. I had been in charge of the makers' studio three years prior when I was a first year, and had worked on projects there on and off over the years. Thus, I had a rough idea of what tools were available. More importantly, I had knowledge from years of projects built using limited tools, so I had some confidence that I could accomplish my goal of restarting the badge booth by using limited tools in ways they were not designed for.  

Once in the studio, I felt hopeful in solving the issue without having a concrete plan of which specific tools I would use and how I would use them. I had to assess what tools were available for me to use in replacing the broken press body. I began by looking for a screwdriver bit of the right size, but was unable to find one. Eventually, with a spray can of WD-40 and a pair of pliers, I was able to swap the broken body. 

This success was possible only because of the __general__ knowledge about the tools in maker's studio enabled me to think through the possible actions I could take. __General__ experience with fixing mechanical problems helped me get through the unforeseen problem I was facing.  That was why even with no concrete steps to follow, I could take individual steps toward my goal of fixing the badge press and continuing the booth. These were ways that I (unknowingly) was prepared to solve the problem.

This idea of experience preparing us for unexpected situations and serving as a partial replacement for detailed planning seems to also explain why I was willing to go into the badge booth without a detailed plan.

I had run a similar booth at a prior event using the same (now broken) badge press. I had experience with the press and teaching people to use it. Therefore, I had confidence in myself to adapt and react to different participants and the common scenarios. I had encountered some challenges during that previous event, such as encouraging participants unconfident in their art skills. I had addressed these challenges and was prepared for most of the difficulties which I could encounter, so I did not need a concrete plan to address these situations during the collective faire 2023. 

# When can we afford to not plan? 
The three major ideas I which examining these events around my badge booth has helped me identify are:
1. We can afford to not plan when failure is an acceptable outcome.  
2. We can afford to not plan when the problem __must__ be solved __step by step__. A high level of uncertainty makes concrete planning challenging and possibly not worth the effort.
3. We can afford to not plan when experience, both general and specific, has prepared us for the forseen and unforseeen problems which occur.

In the [blog post about stoicism](/pages/stoic.md), I wrote about a distressing scenario when I had neither the time nor energy make a plan and was stuck. In writing this post, I start to wonder if low stakes non-planning can be a method of preparing for these more distressing situations. It would be helpful to have general experience with the stress of soving problems on the spot. I think I might try consciously not planning when I can afford to as a way of preparing for future distressing situations.
