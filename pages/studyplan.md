# combine study plan with badge event  

inital look at study plans during the assignment
- dismissive
- view it as not planning

but after faire, relook these `bad plan` as a form of preparation, keeping things open to change

can afford to not plan (faire)  
vs  
cannot afford to not plan (study plan)


--- 

Now we can compare the two extreme cases, when we cannot afford to not plan, and when we can afford to not plan. By contrasting these two experiences, identify the essential ingredients.

As part of `USR reflection`, I had an assignment where I had to work together with a partner to write a reflective dialogue based on our experiences. I worked with a classmate who had also changed his major.  

In one part of the dialogue, we discussed our planning for the future. We used our __study plans__ as evidence of planning (or lack thereof). These study plans are documents which we created at various points to plan which classes we wanted to take and when we wanted to take them. The intent of a study plan is to help a student chart out their time in university. This activity enables them to plan to satisfy graduation requirements such as industrial expereience on time, but also to make space for opportunities such as exchange programmes.  

When we wrote this dialogue, I was rather dismissive of the quality of my plans.

I viewed my study plans as very sparse and incomplete and not forward looking. I was "making my module selections semester by semester" without an overarching plan.

In contrast, my partner had began his change of major with a fully populated study plan of all the classes he wanted to take. It covered which classes and when he would take them.

Even though he deviated from the plan slightly, I still viewed it as much better planning than my own mess. 

I viewed this was as a failure on my part to plan, especially when compared with my classmate's study plan which was much more concrete at all stages. Because of his good planning, he was able to participate in multiple overseas opportunities, while my perceived lack of planning prevented me from being able to apply.  

This was a very `traditional` idea of planning. Good planning helps you achieve what you want, and bad or lack of planning hinders you. However, a more recent experience has led to me reevaluating my view on my study plans in a more generous light.

This new perspective came from my exprience running a badge pressing booth, which is covered more in depth in [this other post](/pages/badges.md). Through that experience, I distinguished between the ideas of very concrete planning and a more broad idea of preparation.

Writing this other reflection post gives me a new approach to now look back on my study plans.  

With differentiation between the concepts of preparation and concrete plans in mind, I can reevaluate the way I viewed my study plans. With this lens, I might be capable of being more generous to my past self.

It would appear that I had started to consider this idea when originally writing the collaborative post, but had not developed it much. I had recognised that each plan had a purpose for that time that I created them, even though none of them were close to being a complete concrete plan.  

But I should not dismiss the value of my work into these documents even though they are incomplete. They served their value in plotting out the immediate next steps of my academic path, in a way that would __enable future plans__ to be made.

For the year 2 plan, by only noticing what was missing from the plan, I missed the significance of having planned for the essential problems I was facing.  

By changing my idea of a good plan from needing to clearly plot out the __entire__ path to graduation, to one which merely needs to get me to a smaller goal, I am better able to appreciate the value of this partial plan.
It helped to ensure that I would have completed the foundational Computer Science classes by the end of my second academic year, which was essential so that I could fulfill the prerequisites and continue to take higher level classes in subsequent years.

My last text file study plan was the most sparse, being a text document which did not document past classes and only addressed the two semesters that I was planning for. This study plan had a very specific purpose and was tailored to it. The top half was defining which graduation requirements I had yet to fulfil. `narration` The bottom half was for me to select the sequence of classes to fulfil these requirements. Documentation of which classes I had already taken was no longer needed, so it could be omitted. My familiarity with which classes I had taken over the past 4 years meant that when looking at prerequisites of classes I wanted to plan for the last two semesters, I could rely on my recollection to determine if I fulfilled them, as opposed to in earlier study plans, where keeping track of the details of prerequisites and classes are significantly more challenging.

Being closer to graduation, it became more essential to have very concrete steps, and therefore class names appeared. I could no longer afford to move the sequence around too much, as these were my last two semesters. Some classes such as CS218, CS4231 and CS3210 were only available in one semester, so if I did not plan my time properly, I would miss my last opportunity to take them.

I initially viewed these rough `study plans` dismissively, viewing them as bad plans or as not-plans. However, after relooking at them through this new lens, I see that they were useful plans, and if being generous to myself, even good plans which helped my chart a path step by step. At the very end, as graduation loomed near, I had to have very clear plans to achieve my goal. I could no longer afford to "not plan", and needed a clear and concrete plan for graduation. 

In times such as this where details are important and time is limited, I cannot afford not to plan. However, these plans need not be complete grand plans which chart out a prefect path. The later parts of the plan can be left more open for a while, but the immediate plans for the next step have to be clear and concrete.
