# When we cannot afford to plan  

Planning requires time and energy to execute properly. In situations where these ingredients are lacking, insisting on planning or sticking to an existing plan where the assumptions are outdated is futile and might even be counter productive. I observe this situation occuring through a Computer Science project I worked on in the first semester of my fourth year in university, where I applied aspects of stoicism which I learned in USP class which I took in my third year.

## stoicism

In the second semester of my third year, I took a class in USP, UPI2212 Technologies of the Self: from Socrates to Self-Help. We read many authors who had written about different philosophies. One philosophy which caught my interest was stoicism, specifically Epictetus' writings on stoicism.

A simplified understanding of Stoicism as is as a philosophy to life based around a few principles: I control only my thoughts, actions and emotions. Obstacles and setbacks are not things I can change. Therefore, I should not be upset regardless of the outcome. In some modern interpretations, such as by Ryan Holiday, stoicism is a cold, individualistic approach to life.

Epictetus wrote that someone who truly lived by stoicism would not be upset by incidents out of their control. Many readers have interpreted to mean that we should choose not to experience negative emotion when facing setbacks . However, having struggled with various emotional and mental health problems during that same semester. I felt excluded from this philosophy which I otherwise wanted to agreed with and wanted to live by. I therefore decided to use my final essay to try reconciling these differences through reevaluating Epictetus' approach to stoicism.

In that essay, I presented an alternative interpretation of "emotions" by using Seneca's model of passions in “On Anger”.

`An except from my essay which introduces Seneca's model of passions. The first movement is the involuntary experience. The second movement is the thought of action in response to the initial experience. The third movement is the action taken based on the thoughts of the second movement.`

In opposition to the conventional understanding of emotions as purely the feeling, Seneca's model separates the involuntary jolt from the actions which we take in reaction to the emotional jolt. Through separating the experience from the reaction, I presented a method of practicing stoicism by categorizing the involuntary jolt of the first movement and the thoughts of the second movement as part of the reality which we have to accept, while the actions we take in the third movement, being within our control, is the component of emotion which we should control. This was a more empathetic approach where having negative feelings is not something to be criticised, but rather something to accept and work with. This essay was the first step where I attempted to integrate some compassion for the self into my understanding of stoicism.

## CS3219

This understanding was helpful in the subsequent semester when I struggled during project for a computer science class.  

This computer science project I worked on was in CS3219 Software Engineering Principles and Patterns, which I took in the first semester of my 4th year. This was a project where a group of 4 students design a web platform using [microservices](). Each group member designed and built one or two microservices, and we would link them together to form the final product.

Toward the end of the project deadline, I was having a tough time with my mental health. The part of the project report I was supposed to write felt too overwhelming to even begin work on. However, I still wanted to contribute to the project. Hence, I asked a group member to help me break my assigned work down into more manageable sections.

At the time, I thought of this request as merely being accountable to my group mate, as observed from my statement of "but I don't want to not do work either". By communicating my limitations to him, he would not expect work which I was unable to deliver, and would hence be able to plan around my limitations. Furthermore, by offering a method for me to continue contributing, even if I did less than my "fair share", I would not be abandoning the project. Specifically, since I had designed and coded certain parts of the project, only I had a full understanding of those sections and would best be able to explain it in the report. 

My group mate  helped immensely, breaking down the daunting work into more manageable sections which I was then able to slowly work through.

## new knowledge

At the time I merely viewed this as being accountable to a friend, when I look back with some distance, I can see some influence of the philosophy of stoicism which I had internalised appearing in my actions. I had applied the idea of accepting my emotional state and capabilities as an unchangable part of reality, and focus on the actions that I could take in response to the situation. 

In this situation, I did not have the mental capacity to __plan__ out my section of the work. The goal of "do your assigned section" was too large, and I was not able to break it down into smaller actionable steps for myself. Hence I had to rely on my groupmate to plan for me, and I executed the plan he made.  

Without the ability to plan for myself, I was not helpless. I could still figure out what direction I needed to head in, that of finishing the project, and figure out the immediate step I needed to take to get closer to it, asking for help to break down the work.  

I was lucky in this situation to have a good groupmate who was willing to accomodate my request in handling my difficulties. However, based on the way that we handled this situation, perhaps I can attempt to plan to afford a similar case in the future.

Create a plan which accomodates buffer time for unproductive times. If I cannot be assured that I will be able to complete the report a few days before it is due, then I create a project schedule that is not reliant on being able to do so.  

Communicate the possibility of accomodations early. Tell groupmates early about the possibility of the time when I will not be able to focus on work, so that they can plan their own schedules around it. If it does happen, then we have averted a problem. If it does not happen, then there is no loss to the project

These two approaches are a way of being realistic in my expectations of myself. Realistic plans require accepting the reality of my capabilities and shortcomings. When the plan fails due to circumstances out of my control, that same attitude of accepting the reality in front of me will give the clarity required to identify the direction I want to head toward and which immediate step I will take toward that goal.
