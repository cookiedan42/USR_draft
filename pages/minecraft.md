# When we can afford to plan

When we have the luxury of time and energy, it makes sense that we __should__ plan. However, merely having __a__ plan is not a predictor of success. In this reflection, I compare two experiences where conflicts in the purpose of differeent plans caused problems, and through this comparison, come to realise just how important identifying the correct goal is when creating a plan.

## IE project

In Nov 2022, I was doing a class project in IE3105 Fundamentals of Systems Engineering and Architecture. This was a class which “aims to introduce students to the fundamental concepts and underlying principles of systems engineering, including systems thinking, as well as the design and management of complex systems”.  

Our class project was to use these principles taught in class to design a solution for aiding visually impaired users locate and board their desired bus independently.

When beginning this project, I focused on the second half of the project description, putting more concern on the concept of "for visually impaired users" section and less on the concept of "use principles taught in class".  

Therefore, I planned a simple prototype product which fixated on the needs of the visually impaired user audience, and the specific shortcomings of existing bus arrival applications with specific attention to their needs. It would take into account their capabilities and not just be based on our personal experiences of "closing your eyes and imagine trying to board a bus".

Unfortunately,  the professor and my classmates disagreed with my idea of what a "needs" of a blind person would be. I initially argued against them, however, with the deadline of the group project approaching and group mates unwilling to change their minds, I gave in and did the project their way. I built a prototype which fulfilled their product requirements, grumbling the entire way. We wrote and executed a `test plan` in which we blindfolded ourselves and demonstrated our prototype and how we claimed it would satisfy the requirements of the project. We received a good mark for the final project and professor was impressed.

After the semester was over, the professor invited his contact from SG Enable to give feedback on our prototype. A visually impaired person tested our product and gave feedback. Much of what he said aligned with my initial opinions on how useful the prototype we constructed would be.

`An excerpt from the email sent by SG Enable after the feedback session. They validated that we had identified the major pain point and agreed that our solution addressed well.`

Specifically, the tester said during our physical meeting that a much simpler product which identified and announced the unique 5-digit bus stop code would be most useful. He could then use the information with a bus arrival application which he was already familiar with. 

My planned product would very likely have been more useful to the visually impaired tester. I had successfully identified the pertinent issues in this plan and was taking steps to address them. Why did these shortcomings of the produced prototype not affect us in our final grading?

Drawing insight from a different planning experience sheds some light on the reason.

## Minecraft

In July 2021, because of the covid-19 restrictions, university orientation programmes were moved online. USP decided to hold part of our online orientation programme in the game Minecraft. I joined the project late, at a stage when most of the plans were finalized.  

When joining the project, I had many concerns with the planned sequence of activities. The camp would begin with games which required familiarity with game controls and mechanics. I was concerned that participants who had not played Minecraft or other first-person games would struggle to participate. Furthermore, participants would have a diminished experience if they were stuck resolving technical issues while their peers were having fun in competitive games. I expressed my concern first verbally, then followed up by sending messages to our games committee group chat.

I was concerned about the experience that the participants would have while engaging with the activities when I sent these messages. I further suggested that the participants' first exposure to Minecraft should be the activity where they worked with their `house-mates` to build on an island. This would be a less time-sensitive activity which would allow us time to resolve any technical issues and let participants familiarise themselves with the game mechanics which they would use in subsequent games. However, the programme organizer disagreed and initially resisted my proposal, sending this rebuttal to the same group chat.

They believed that we should not make any changes to the sequence of events because they had already sent out the camp booklet containing the schedules to participants. 

At the time, I completely disagreed with the idea that keeping to a plan which I thought was inferior. However,looking back now, when looking at the problem from a whole camp perspective instead of from a minecraft experience perspective, I see some merit in their approach. I still disagree, but I understand wehre they were coming from. They were concerned that sending out a new digital booklet might confuse participants who might be looking at their printed schedule and wonder why the activity they were participating in did not match.

## Wrong purpose

Plans must have a purpose. Minecraft organisers' plan had a purpose of giving participants of an online camp clarity, while my plan for rearranging the schedule had the purpose of improving one aspect of the camp experience. When the purposes of two different plans come into conflict, then it can be difficult or even impossible to resolve them.

With this concept of the purpose of plans, I can re-evaluate my thoughts on the interim report I submitted for the IE3105 project.

`Excerpts from interim report submitted for IE3105. I received the lowest mark in the class, 6/10, because the professor said it was “only a concept” and “lacked a detailed design”.`

At the time I was angry because my report scored so low. I had included detailed explanations for the design elements which would be included or omitted from my proposed solution, and further assessments of how feasible these elements would be to prototype. I had lost marks for not including a `detailed design`, for a product which had not been developed to that level yet. Meanwhile, some classmates had scored much better by submitting  solutions which were very impractical to prototype, but had included detailed designs.

The purpose of my interim report was in line with my purpose of creating a good product for a visually impaired user. However, this was not aligned with the purpose of the project. I was too focused on the second half of the question when the first half of the assignment question of "using the skills taught" should have been my focus if I wanted to score well in the assessments. When my groupmates did not care as much about the specifics of the visually impaired user, nor the feasibility of the detailed designs they had submitted, they were planning with the project's assessment criteria in mind. 

Furthermore, I now understand that the interim report was meant to force us to adhere to the structure of creating that detailed design as part of the report even if it was to be scrapped going forward. The goal of the assignmetn was to practice a specific skill, but by approaching it with the wrong goal in mind, I missed the target and hence received a bad grade.

Merely having a the correct goal for our plan is not enough. There will often be conflicting goals which require different plans. Choosing between them will be challenging. If I have to choose for myself, that is not too hard, but convincing others or being convinced by others is more challenging. When convincing others, communiccating the purpose behind the plan would be very useful. If I was told specifically that the camp organisers wanted to avoid confusing the participants, I might have been more accepting of the reason, as opposed to merely that "the booklets have been sent out". If I had understood earler that the primary goal of the IE3105 project was to apply the formalisms of systems engineering over creating a good product, perhaps I might have argued less.
